# Numerical_Methods
This repository includes a variety of code relevant to an introductory Numerical Methods course. It is sorted by subject, and then further by language.

## CS Preliminary

A collection of programs that demonstrate how computers store numbers and detect/correct errors in transmitted data. It is important to understand how floating-point numbers are represented in computer memory because this knowledge can provide insight into the cause of rounding errors and so-called 'catastrophic cancellation'
  - MATLAB
    - Forward Error Correction by parity checking
      - Show how a FEC scheme called 'parity checking' can detect and correct errors in transmitted data

## ODEs

A collection numerical solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) 
  - MATLAB
    - Euler (RK1) method
      - Demonstrate the Euler / Runge-Kutta order 1 method, and plot the calculated result against the symbolic solution of the ODE-IVP.

## Root Finding

  A suite for root-finding algorithms
  - MATLAB 
    - Bisection Method
      - Demonstrate the bisection method of root finding, and discuss how the algorithm depends on results of the Intermediate-Value Theorem.
    - Secant Method
      - Demonstrate the secant method of root finding
    
## Numerical Integration

  A suite for numerical integration schemes
  - MATLAB
    - Uniform Trapezoid Method
      - Demonstrate the uniform trapezoid method of numerical integration
