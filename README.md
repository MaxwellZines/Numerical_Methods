# Numerical Methods

Maxwell Zines (MATLAB, Python, ASM) and Elias Martin (R)

We are building this repository as free, open-source reference material for students taking an undergraduate-level introductory Numerical Analysis course. Because it is intended as reference material instead of serious scientific computing, many of the processes (iterating, input-gathering...) are written to emphasize clarity over computing cost or efficiency. We have tried to include as many comments as possible without "getting in the way" or "breaking the flow" of the actual code. **We highly encourage any curious individual to mess around with the code - break it, test it, build it better, fork it!**

Also remember that this introductory code base is exactly that: *introductory*. There are many fantastic resources online that go into elaborate detail about each of these algorithms, including proofs of convergence speed. You should absolutely seek further knowledge into each of these topics, including information about conditions under which each may fail to converge on an answer. Numerical Analysis can be a very technical subject - technicalities and formalities have their place, but we have tried to avoid it here wherever possible.

We are currently in the process of building the repository for Python, MATLAB, R, and MIPS ASM. We intend to add support for Haskell, Mathematica, and C.

ASM scripts are written for MIPS ASM and compiled with the MARS IDE. Using other IDEs may cause unexpected results, especially with syscall functions.

The Wiki has a complete, sorted list of algorithms included in this repository. It also has a complete list of works cited.
