    This code is a demonstration of one particular Monte Carlo pi approximator.
Two random numbers, x and y, are generated on x,y âˆˆ (-1,1). A running sum
keeps count of the number of points within the circle against the number of 
points total. Convergence to pi/4 is expected, and the final result is 
multiplied by 4 to produce a result that is expected to converge to pi.
    This code uses the following extensions: random.
